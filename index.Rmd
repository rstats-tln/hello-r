# Intro

## Why data visualisation matters

- Numerical summaries, like arithmetic mean or correlation coefficient, can be deceiving when shape of the data is not known or shown

- Visualisation of your analysis results or data must be effective and present your results and data honestly

???

- think of average salary or **datasaurus**

---

## Start every analysis by visualisation

- Data visualisation is natural starting point of every data analysis workflow

- Let's have look at the **datasaurus** dataset
    - here we have x and y variables for 13 variables (away, bullseye, etc.) 

```{r}
library(datasauRus)
datasaurus_dozen_wide
```

---

## Statistical properties of each dataset

- What is the correlation between x and y in different datasets?
- Here we calculate correlation coefficient for each dataset:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
datasaurus_dozen %>% 
  group_by(dataset) %>% 
  summarise(`Pearson's r` = cor(x, y))
```

---

## How are x and y related to each other?

- We can see that all these datasets display similar relationship between x and y variable
- What about mean and standard deviation?
```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>% 
  group_by(dataset) %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(x, y), funs(mean, sd))
```

---

## Conclusion???

- We have dozen datasets with similar statistical properties
- We can conclude that all these datasets have same parameters and come from from the same data generating process
- As a final nuisance, let's create a some kind of plot (you know, reviewer...)

---

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen) +
  geom_point(ggplot2::aes(x, y)) +
  facet_wrap(~ dataset)
```

> "never trust summary statistics alone; always visualize your data", since, while the data exhibits normal seeming statistics, plotting the data reveals a picture of a dinosaur.

## Summary

- Data analysis is not entirely linear process and includes steps where you move in circles
- After you have imported your data into analysis environment, you enter iterative process of data transformation, **visualisation**, and modeling, where you can spin until exhaustion
